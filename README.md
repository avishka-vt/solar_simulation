# Reactive Solar Cell Simulation ðŸŒž
This repository contains a Reactive Solar Cell Simulation tool that allows users to explore how different parameters affect the performance of solar cells. The simulation includes:

1. Interactive Inputs : Users can adjust light intensity, angle of incidence, solar cell material, and area to observe real-time changes in output.
2. Photovoltaic Cell Diagram : A visual representation of how sunlight interacts with the solar cell at different angles and intensities.
3. Generations of Solar Cells : A dedicated page explaining the evolution of photovoltaic technologies across four generations.

This tool is designed for educational purposes, providing insights into the science and technology behind solar energy.

## Features

- Interactive Simulation :
Adjust light intensity, angle of incidence, solar cell material, and area.
Real-time calculation of voltage, current, maximum power, and efficiency.
- Visual Representation :
Dynamic diagram showing photon absorption, electron-hole pair generation.
- Educational Content :
Comprehensive page on the four generations of photovoltaic cells, including materials, efficiencies, advantages, and challenges.
