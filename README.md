# Reactive Solar Cell Simulation ðŸŒž
This repository contains a Reactive Solar Cell Simulation tool that allows users to explore how different parameters affect the performance of solar cells. The simulation includes:

1. Interactive Inputs : Users can adjust light intensity, angle of incidence, solar cell material, and area to observe real-time changes in output.
2. Photovoltaic Cell Diagram : A visual representation of how sunlight interacts with the solar cell at different angles and intensities.
3. Generations of Solar Cells : A dedicated page explaining the evolution of photovoltaic technologies across four generations.

This tool is designed for educational purposes, providing insights into the science and technology behind solar energy.
